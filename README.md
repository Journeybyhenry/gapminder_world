# Gapminder World Analysis

For this project, I'm working on Gapminder World Datasets as a requirement for the Data Analytics Nanodegree program on Udacity. The dataset provides data for years ranging from 1800 to 2050 (predictions) in some indicator. In this project I will be working with data for 2008 and 2018 only, this giving us a 10 year gap for analysis.

## Key indicators for analysis:

Income Variables (independent) - Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (Measured in International Dollars)
Life Expectancy - Measured in Years.
Babies per Woman - The number of babies that will be born to each woman with the prevailing age-specific fertility rate.
Working Hours per week - measured in hours. Total yearly amount of working hours divided by 52 weeks.
Human Development Index - ranges from 0 - 1
Happiness Score - expressed in Percentage
In the analysis, these are my research questions:

Which countries recorded the highest income in 2008 and 2018 respectively?
Do countries that make more Income produce more babies in 2008?
Which country is the happiest in 2008.
Are countries who make more Income happier in 2018?
What sort of correlation exist between the income made in a country and other indicators?
Which country's income improved the most in 2018 compared to 2008
Which Continent had the highest income 2018?
Which African countries had the lowest income in 2018?
Which country's income improved the most in 2018 compared to 2008?
